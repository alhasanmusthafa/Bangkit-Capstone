## About Donor Go

"In Indonesia, every minute there is one person in need of a blood transfusion."
"Every minute, there is one person in Indonesia who needs a blood transfusion."

The availability of an adequate blood supply is crucial in saving the lives of those who require blood transfusions. Every minute, there is one person who needs a blood transfusion. However, in reality, ensuring an adequate blood supply often poses challenges, both due to limited blood stocks in hospitals and difficulties in finding suitable blood donors.

The unmet availability of blood supply presents a challenge as it can lead to further complications for those in need, such as organ damage or even death due to blood shortages. Lack of public awareness about the importance of becoming blood donors, low participation in blood donation activities, and limited blood stocks in nearby hospitals contribute to this issue.

To meet the urgent need for blood transfusions and address the inadequate blood supply, it is important to raise public awareness about the importance of becoming blood donors, ensure sufficient blood stocks in hospitals, and strengthen collaboration between hospitals, blood donation organizations, and communities to overcome the challenges of obtaining blood supply that matches the demand.

The development of the DonorGo application can provide an innovative solution to address various problems faced in this regard. This application is designed and packaged with the primary goal of enhancing blood availability and connecting volunteer blood donors with those in need, facilitating the process of finding blood donors. This will facilitate blood transfusion services in various hospitals in the Riau Province, particularly in terms of social and humanitarian services.

DonorGo offers several features, including:

Creating blood donation requests
Donating blood for patients
Voluntary blood donation (to increase blood stocks in hospitals)
Searching for blood stocks in hospitals
Finding nearby blood requests from patients in need
Information on mass blood donation events
Articles on blood donation
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
We also incorporate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the application for donor identification to provide a sense of security and assurance for users.
The biggest challenge we face as developers of the DonorGo application is the time required for development. Designing the OCR feature involves a considerable amount of time, including building model structures, training and testing, as well as other aspects in the fields of Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Mobile Development.

In the future, DonorGo will strive to address any shortcomings in the application and introduce new innovations to support its functionality, particularly for the admin dashboard, which will greatly impact data management, event and news information, as well as validation when volunteers donate blood at specific hospitals. We will continue to conduct training and testing to make DonorGo even better.
