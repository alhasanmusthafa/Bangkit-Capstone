# **Machine Learning**

Machine learning (ML) is defined as a discipline of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides machines the ability to automatically learn from data and past experiences to identify patterns and make predictions with minimal human intervention. In this Machine Learning section, we make OCR for KTP and this function is to validate the user in our application. And for the model itself we put it in our Drive because several model that we made have a large size

Google Drive for model : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wSpkMhaKiAB5KmO0xKis2JB4q0tftvNn?usp=sharing
