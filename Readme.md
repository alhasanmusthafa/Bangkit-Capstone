## About Donor Go

"In Indonesia, every minute there is one person in need of a blood transfusion."
The availability of an adequate blood supply is crucial in saving the lives of those in need of blood transfusions. Every minute, there is one person who requires a blood transfusion. However, the reality is that ensuring an adequate blood supply often poses challenges, whether due to limited blood stocks in hospitals or difficulties in finding suitable blood donors.

The unmet availability of blood supply presents a challenge as it can lead to new problems for individuals in need, such as organ damage or even death due to blood shortages. Lack of public awareness about the importance of becoming blood donors, low participation in blood donation activities, and limited blood stocks in nearby hospitals contribute to these challenges.

To address the urgent need for blood transfusions and the inadequate blood supply, it is crucial to raise public awareness about the importance of becoming blood donors, ensure sufficient blood stocks in hospitals, and strengthen collaborations between hospitals, blood donation organizations, and communities to overcome the challenges in obtaining blood supply that meets the needs.

The development of the DonorGo application can provide an innovative solution to address various issues. This application is designed with the main objective of improving blood availability and serving as a platform to connect volunteer blood donors with those in need, facilitating the blood donor search process. It will enhance the transfusion services in various hospitals in the Riau Province, particularly in terms of social and humanitarian services.

DonorGo offers several features, such as:

- Requesting blood donations
- Donating blood for patients
- Voluntary blood donation
- Searching for blood stocks in nearby hospitals
- Finding the nearest blood donation requests from patients
- Providing information about mass blood donation events
- Articles about blood donation
- Frequently Asked Questions
- We also incorporate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology in the application to ensure the safety and verification of donor identities.

One of the main challenges we encountered as developers of the DonorGo application was the time required for development. Designing the OCR feature involved considerable time, from building the model structure to training and testing, as well as other aspects related to Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Mobile Development.

Moving forward, DonorGo will strive to address the existing limitations of the application and introduce new innovations to support its functionality. Continuous training and testing will be conducted to make DonorGo an even better application.
