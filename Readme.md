# **Machine Learning**

Machine learning (ML) is defined as a discipline of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides machines the ability to automatically learn from data and past experiences to identify patterns and make predictions with minimal human intervention. In this Machine Learning section, we make OCR for KTP and this function is to validate the user in our application. And for the model itself we put it in our Drive because several model that we made have a large size.

# **OCR KTP**

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, which is a technology used in machine learning to automatically recognize and extract text from images or scanned documents. It involves converting the text contained in these visual representations into machine-readable and editable formats.
